# ToDo List.

"To-do list" is a tool that helps to organize your day. It simply lists the things that you need to do and allows you to mark them as complete.

[![Minimalist example](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/d04bee7a5b8f62cc6655dbec65c4d14583e4d78d0c434ddc070f6881bb9568fc/68747470733a2f2f696d672e796f75747562652e636f6d2f76692f416355642d5f596a6a71672f302e6a7067)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcUd-_Yjjqg)

### Project Requirements

- Set up a new project with webpack.
- Create an index.html file and write your HTML markup here. The index.html file must be set as a template using the HTML Webpack Plugin.
- Create an index.js file and set an array of some simple to do tasks (array of objects). Each task object should contain three keys:
  - description [string].
  - completed [bool].
  - index: [number].
- Write a function to iterate over the tasks array and populate an HTML list item element for each task.
- On page load render the dynamically created list of tasks in the dedicated placeholder. The list should appear in order of the index values for each task.
  Create a style.css and set rules for the To Do List. CSS must be loaded by Webpack Style/CSS Loader. Your list should be a clone of the part of the minimalist project captured in the video below.
